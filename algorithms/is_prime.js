1. check Prime
Question: How would you verify a prime number?

Answer: a prime number is only divisible by itself and 1.
So, i will run a while loop and increase by 1. 
(look at the code example. If you dont get it. this is not your cake.
do learn javaScript basics and come back.)

function isPrime (num) {
    let questionableFactor = 2;
    let result = true
    if(num === 2){
      result = true
    }
    else{
        for( let i = questionableFactor; i < num; i++){
            if(num % questionableFactor === 0){
                result = false;
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}

module.exports = isPrime;

// this will be O(N) because we have one for loop
